# Django Starters

Django Starters will walk users through the process of creating their own Django Templates that can be used to easily start new Django web development projects.  Specifically, we will focus on the minimum requirements for setting up a development environment, advanced project layouts, settings and tooling systems. 

## Starters

This repo has many subdirectories called `starters`.  Each `starter` is a guide that is going to walk through one concept or technique.  What follows is an overview of the `starters` currently available.

**starter_01**
> This guide will show users how to start using vagrant and django

**starter_02**
> This guide will show users how to make a provisioning script for Vagrant

**starter_03**
> This guide will show users how to make a smarter provisioning script for vagrant

**starter_04**
> This guide will introduce users to a scaffolding tool called cookiecutter


### Who this is for

Anyone who wants to learn about Django web development.  This repo is a refined version of the notes that I took when I started learning Django.  I hope that it can save you some time and questions and provide a quickstart into exploring some of the more advanced offerings of web development.  

### Goals

This repo is a way for me to acknowledge the time and hard work that others before me have put into writing and freely sharing their own knowledge and maybe give something back to the web development community.  In doing so, I will strive to achieve the following: 

2.  **Open Discussion:**  I am going to make choices that work for me, but I want readers to have, at the least, the opporunity to see that there are other choices.  Therefore, I will attempt to have open discussion in my writing whenever possible exploring alternatives or clarifying what appear to be vague points.  
3.  **Maintenance:**  The first thing that I do before reading any web development guides is check the date.  Is it older than 6 months?  1 year?  It may still be useful, but depending on the technology it could be out of date.  I don't want that to happen to this repo so I will commit time to creating a process to test the code in this repo every few months to keep it up to date.  

### Community Support

I am a believer in the community creating things together.  If you are reading through anything I have written here and find that it is incorrect, outdated or lacking in proper documentation, please feel free to make a PR.
