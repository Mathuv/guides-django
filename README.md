# Django Starters

Django Starters will walk users through the process of creating you're own Django Templates that can be used to easily start new Django web development projects.  Specifically, we will focus on the minimum requirements for setting up a development environment, advanced project layouts, settings and tooling systems. 

## Starters

This repo has many subdirectorie called `starters`.  Each `starter` is a guide that is going to walk through one concept or technique.  For example, See below for an overview of the starters currently available.

**starter_01**
> This guide will show users how to start using vagrant and django

**starter_02**
> This guide will show users how to make a provisioning script for Vagrant

**starter_03**
> This guide will show users how to make a smarter provisioning script for vagrant

**starter_04**
> This guide will introduce users to a scaffolding tool called cookiecutter


### Who this is for

At the moment, this project is geared towards <a href="http://zedshaw.com/2015/06/16/early-vs-beginning-coders/" target="_blank">early</a> to intermediate Django developers.  What is an early Django developer? At this point, you have already completed some tutorials like the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank">official Django tutorial</a> or <a href="http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">something similar</a> and maybe completed a small sized project with Django - like a blog.  Still don't know if you are an early Django developer?  Can you describe, with ease and clarity, what the `startproject` command does without referencing the Django documentation?  Yes?  You are good to go.

**NOTE:** Even if you haven't done anything with Django, this can still be a useful read.  Just because your a beginner does not mean you won't get anything out of it.  Give it a try!

### Goals

If this helps someone learn Django a little better, mission accomplished.  Thus, I am hoping that I can add something to the Django community and in support of this goal, I have tried to focus on a few things.

1.  One of my aims for this is objectivity.  I believe it is important to choose tools that work for you and your project.  With this in mind, there comes a point where you have to make a decision.  You, the reader, might not agree with some of the choices I have made.  Thus, in the name of objectivity and transparency, I have tried to flag as many sections where other choices could have been made.  When I come across these sections, I like to have a little discussion about why I did what I did and some of the alternatives available to you.

2.  I would like to keep this project well maintained.  In support of this effort, I will be setting up an automated process that will be able to test these templates on my behalf so they continue to be useful to the Django community.    

### Community Support

I am a believer in the community creating things together.  If you are reading through anything I have written here and find that it is incorrect, outdated or lacking in proper documentation, please feel free to make a PR.
