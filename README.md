# Django Starters

This repository contains a series Django starter templates.  Each template can be used as a starting point for your project.  The first template is an almost exact replica of the `django-admin startproject` template.  Each subsequent template adds additional configurations to `startproject`.  

### Motivation
 
When I started building a template that worked for me, I started by looking at what [others were doing in the django community](https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/project-templates/).  My main area of interest was the decision making process that went into them.  So I started to build templates and as I was making them I made some notes.  

I created this repository to illustrate the process that goes into creating a Django template.  I hope that it can be used as a learning tool.   

### The Structure

Each repository is a Django template that can be used as is.  Each template has a guide that outlines the changes made and why I made them.  

### Goals

If this helps someone learn Django a little better, mission accomplished.  Thus, I am hoping that I can add something to the Django community and in support of this goal, I have tried to focus on a few things.

1.  One of my aims for this is objectivity.  I believe it is important to choose tools that work for you and your project.  With this in mind, there comes a point where you have to make a decision.  You, the reader, might not agree with some of the choices I have made.  Thus, in the name of objectivity and transparency, I have tried to flag as many sections where other choices could have been made.  When I come across these sections, I like to have a little discussion about why I did what I did and some of the alternatives available to you.

2.  I would like to keep this project well maintained.  In support of this effort, I will be setting up an automated process that will be able to test these templates on my behalf so they continue to be useful to the Django community.    

### Community Support

I am a believer in the community creating things together.  If you are reading through anything I have written here and find that it is incorrect, outdated or lacking in proper documentation, please feel free to make a PR.
