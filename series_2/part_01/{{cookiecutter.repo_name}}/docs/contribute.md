###ISSUES

This project has issues.  Some are assigned, and others are not.  Take one that are not assigned, or are assigned to you!

If you spot a bug, or something that needs to be done, please create an issue.  This is done in bitbucket by running through the following steps:

```
login to your account
enter your repo
click on the left side menu icon that, when hovered over, says 'issues' 
+ create issue in top right corner
```

###COMMITS

Commits are part of the history of your project.  Every time you make a change that works toward solving an issue, make sure to commit it with an informative and easy to read message.  Please follow this format:

```
ISSUE <#> - <TYPE> - <BRIEF DESCRIPTION>

<LONG FORM DESCRIPTION>
```

Everything in angle brackets above is something your are going to change. Thus, the following is the ideal commit format

```
ISSUE #76 - TASK - SAMPLE COMMIT MESSAGE

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
```
